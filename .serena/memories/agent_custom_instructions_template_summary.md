Custom instructions file added at docs/custom-instructions.md. It summarizes PumpTracker Lite scope, stack, core flow (PO -> Kanban/Scheduling -> Dashboard -> Close), required charts/topics (Financials, Production Mgmt via ChartProps + registry), scheduling revamp requirements (drag/resize scheduled jobs, capacity/man-hour limits, locks, rules, auto-level), coding constraints (reuse store, UI primitives, keep build green), and what not to do. Use this for onboarding agentic developers as "Custom Instructions".
