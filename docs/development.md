# Development Guide

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (or npm/yarn)

### Development

To run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Build

To build the project for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

The production-ready files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Agent Browser Instructions

AI agents with built-in browser capabilities can view the running app:

1. **Start the dev server**:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Use `browser_subagent`** to navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`

3. **Available views**:
   - Dashboard: `/` (default) — KPIs, charts, order table
   - Kanban: Click Kanban icon in header — drag-and-drop stage columns
   - Scheduling: Click calendar icon — backlog dock + calendar grid

## Development Conventions

### Environment Setup

```bash
pnpm install          # install dependencies
pnpm dev              # start Vite on http://localhost:8080
PNPM_TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 pnpm playwright test  # see testing.md for details
```

Use **pnpm** for scripts. The dev server will warn if the port is taken; adjust with `pnpm dev --port <port> --host 0.0.0.0` and pass the same URL to Playwright.

### Coding Conventions

- **Components**: colocate feature-specific components under `src/components/<feature>`. Shared primitives belong in `src/components/ui`.
- **State**: extend `src/store.ts` with new selectors/actions rather than adding ad-hoc React state. Persisted settings belong in the Zustand partializer.
- **Styling**: Tailwind for layout + utilities. If a style is reused, promote it to `src/index.css` (see `.header-button`, `.stage-color-*`, `.scrollbar-themed`).
- **Data**: `PumpCard` is the canonical representation of a pump, now reused on both Kanban and Scheduling. If you need different drag behavior, adjust the `draggableConfig` prop instead of duplicating markup.

### Feature Tips

- **Legend Filters**: `schedulingStageFilters` should only influence the scheduling view. If you need a new quick filter, keep it scoped and let the global `filters` state continue to affect every page.
- **Sorting**: Respect `sortField` + `sortDirection` when listing pumps. Import `sortPumps` rather than rolling custom sorts.
- **Calendar Layout**: `MainCalendarGrid` assumes six weeks of data and uses the stage filter set to drop non-selected events. When modifying the timeline, ensure `projectSegmentsToWeek` remains pure.

### How to Add a Feature

1.  **Plan**: capture goals in `docs/README.md` (link to any new design doc).
2.  **Update Store**: add actions/selectors and persist state when needed.
3.  **Implement UI**: reuse `PumpCard`, `Button`, etc. to keep styling consistent.
4.  **Document**: update README and/or `docs/` with any new workflows, configs, or env vars.
5.  **Test**: run `pnpm test` and the relevant Playwright spec before opening a PR.

## Testing

### Unit & Integration (Vitest)

```bash
pnpm test              # run all suites
pnpm test src/store.ts # run a specific file
```

Vitest covers hooks, the Zustand store, scheduling helpers, and core components. Add new specs under `src/` or `tests/components` as appropriate.

### End-to-End (Playwright)

Playwright tests live in `tests/e2e`. The config expects a running dev server; set the base URL with an environment variable:

```bash
pnpm dev &           # start Vite on port 8080
PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 pnpm playwright test
```

Useful scripts:

- `pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/scheduling-enhanced.spec.ts --project=chromium`
- `pnpm playwright test --headed --project=chromium` (interactive)
- `pnpm playwright test --ui` (Playwright Test UI)

### Verifying the Stage Legend Filters

1.  Seed a few events by dragging jobs from the backlog to the calendar.
2.  Click one of the legend buttons (`data-stage-filter="FABRICATION"`).
3.  Ensure only events whose `data-stage` matches remain.
4.  Click the same button again to clear the quick filter.

The `stage legend filters calendar events` test inside `tests/e2e/scheduling-enhanced.spec.ts` automates this workflow. If it fails, confirm:

- `schedulingStageFilters` is wired through `SchedulingView` to `MainCalendarGrid`.
- Legend buttons have the `data-stage-filter` attribute and call `toggleSchedulingStageFilter`.
- Playwright is pointed at the correct dev server port.

### Linting & Type Checking

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm tsc --noEmit`

Run these before publishing a PR.
