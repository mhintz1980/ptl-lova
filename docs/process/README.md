# Process Index (Load Only When Needed)

This folder holds the “deep rules” so AGENTS.md stays small.

## What to read when

- **Starting work / unsure what the rules are** → `constitutional-core-rules.md`
- **Changing behavior or contracts** → `documentation-retcon.md`
- **Deciding how simple is “simple enough”** → `implementation-philosophy.md`
- **Designing modular pieces / parallel builds** → `modular-design.md`
- **Doing a big refactor across many files** → `code-implementation.md` (file crawl templates)
- **Reviewing a major step** → `code-review.md`
- **Preparing to merge/push** → `cleanup-and-push.md`
