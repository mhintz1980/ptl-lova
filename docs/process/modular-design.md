# Modular Design Philosophy (Brick Mindset)

Think “LEGO set,” not “hand-carved statue.”

## The idea
Build from small, clear modules (“bricks”) with crisp boundaries:
- Each brick can be built, tested, and replaced independently.
- Bricks can be reassembled into new products quickly.

## Why this matters with AI
AI is great at producing code, but drift happens fast without strong seams.
Modularity keeps regeneration safe:
- Replace a brick, not the building.
- Rebuild pieces in parallel without entanglement.

## The human role
Humans act as architects:
- define the target shape (spec)
- enforce boundaries (contracts)
- choose what stays simple vs what needs rigor
