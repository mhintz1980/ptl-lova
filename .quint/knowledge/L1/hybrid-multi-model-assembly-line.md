# Hypothesis: Hybrid Multi-Model Assembly Line

Orchestrate all available models in a pipeline based on their strengths:

**Stage 1 - Research (Gemini Pro High)**: Analyze current charts, identify aesthetic gaps, research modern dashboard patterns

**Stage 2 - Visual Design (Gemini Flash)**: Generate 5-10 visual mockup variations showing different aesthetic directions (color schemes, layouts, typography)

**Stage 3 - Design System (Claude Opus)**: Create comprehensive design token system from chosen visual direction

**Stage 4 - Implementation Planning (Sonnet 4.5 Thinking)**: Break down implementation into steps, identify dependencies

**Stage 5 - Code Generation (Sonnet 4.5)**: Generate actual React/Recharts code with Tailwind styling

**Stage 6 - Validation (Gemini Pro Low)**: Review generated code for accessibility, performance, best practices

Implementation: User acts as "foreman," running each stage sequentially and passing outputs between models.

## Rationale
{"anomaly": "Single-model approaches waste capabilities or miss steps", "approach": "Use each model for its strongest capability in assembly line", "alternatives_rejected": ["Single model (suboptimal results)", "Random model assignment (inefficient)"]}
