# Hypothesis: AI-Assisted Design System Generation

Use Claude Opus 4.5 to analyze current chart aesthetics and generate a comprehensive design system specification. Opus will:
1. Analyze existing dashboard charts for visual inconsistencies
2. Research modern data visualization best practices
3. Generate a cohesive design system (color palettes, typography, spacing, animations)
4. Create component-level specifications for each chart type
5. Provide CSS-in-JS or Tailwind utility classes for implementation

Implementation: Feed Opus the current chart components, have it output a design token system and reusable chart wrapper components.

## Rationale
{"anomaly": "Charts lack visual cohesion and modern aesthetics", "approach": "Leverage Opus's superior reasoning to create systematic design language", "alternatives_rejected": ["Manual iteration (slow, inconsistent)", "Copying existing designs (may not fit data visualization needs)"]}
